# Employee Attrition Analysis and Visualisation on Tableau

## Overview
Analyzed employee attrition for a pharmaceutical company using a dataset of 1,467 records and 35 feature variables. Developed a Tableau dashboard with 14 visualizations (e.g., KPI, Department, Gender, Age Group) to identify attrition patterns. Key findings: 19.15% attrition rate, higher male attrition (172 vs. 108 females), and significant turnover in Research & Development (133) and Sales (136). Recommended focusing on R&D and Sales retention strategies.

## Tools
- Tableau

## Methodology
Imported dataset into R Studio for initial summary, addressed data quality issues, and created visualizations using Tableauâ€™s KPI, donut charts, and tables for metrics like Job Satisfaction and Work Life Balance.

## Findings
- Older employees (>35) and those with 3-4 prior companies were less likely to resign.
- High Job Involvement and Work Life Balance scores still showed attrition, suggesting correlated factors.

## Recommendations
- Target R&D and Sales for retention.
- Improve work-life balance.
- Consider machine learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for predictive analytics.
